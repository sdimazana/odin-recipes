                <ul>
                    <li>140 grams granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>400 mL whole milk</li>
                    <li>100 mL heavy whipping cream</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>

                    <li>
                        Custard molds (five 220-mL molds,
                        six 150-mL molds, or seven 120-mL

                    <h5>STEPS</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Gather all the ingredients. You will 
                            have to be prepared to complete each 
                            step quickly once you begin cooking.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Preheat the oven to 300ºF. Boil 3 to 
                            4 cups of water and keep it hot. This 
                            water will be used for the caramel 
                            sauce and bain-marie. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a heavy-bottomed small saucepan, 
                            combine 70 g of sugar and 1 tbsp of 
                            room temperature water. Turn the heat 
                            to medium low and let the sugar dissolve 
                            without stirring. Tilt the pot to help 
                            dissolve the sugar. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the sugar has dissolved, increase 
                            the heat to medium. Swirl the saucepan 
                            occasionally but do not mix it with a 
                            utensil. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the sugar starts to caramelize, 
                            you will see lots of small bubbles. It 
                            will slowly turn brown on the edges of 
                            the pan. Swirl the pot to incorporate 
                            the dark-colored caramelized sugar into 
                            the light-colored sugar. Soon, the bubbles 
                            will become larger as the sugar mixture 
                            caramelizes more and turns an amber color.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The caramelized sugar will continue to 
                            turn darker and darker. Keep swirling the 
                            pot and watch it closely. After the caramel 
                            sauce starts smoking, wait a tiny bit longer 
                            until it reaches an optimal dark caramel 
                            color. Then turn off the heat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Immediately pour a portion of the 1 tbsp 
                            hot water onto a spatula into the caramel 
                            pot (so your hand is not directly above the 
                            pot). The mixture will boil vigorously and 
                            sputter, so be careful not to let it splatter 
                            on you. Once this has subsided, slowly add 
                            the rest of the hot water. Swirl the saucepan 
                            to combine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Immediately pour equal portions of the caramel 
                            sauce into the molds. Do not worry if the caramel 
                            hardens before you can coat the entire mold. 
                            When you add the hot milk later, the caramel 
                            will melt and coat the whole mold. 
                        </li>

                            Beat three large eggs in a separate bowl

                            In a small saucepan, whisk together 400 
                            mL whole milk, 100 mL heavy whipping cream,

                            While whisking continuously, add 1/3 of the 
                            hot milk mixture to the bowl with the egg 
                            mixture. Continue to slowly add the rest of 
                            the milk mixture while whisking continuously.

                            Pop the bubbles on the surface of the custard 
                            by quickly touching them with a flame from a 
                            lighter or a toothpick.

                            Place the molds in a baking pan that is at 
                            least 2 inches deep. Add enough hot water to 
                            the pan so that the water comes up halfway 
                            to the molds.

                        <li>
                            Bake the pudding at 300ºF for 35-45 minutes 
                            or until the custard is set.

                        <li>
                            You can check that the pudding is done by 
                            jiggling it. If it sloshes like liquid, it 
                            is not done. Once they are done, let them 
                            cool completely on a wire rack.
