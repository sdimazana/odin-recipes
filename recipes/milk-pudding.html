            <li>400 mL of whole milk</li>
            <li>100 mL of heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 large eggs (50 grams each without shell)</li>
            <li>70 grams of granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Making the caramel sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 300째F (150째C). For a convection oven,
                reduce the cooking temperature by 25째F (15째C).
            </li>
            <li>
                In a heavy-bottomed small saucepan, combine 70 grams of sugar
                and 1 tbsp of room temperature water. Avoid using nonstick
                saucepans. They tend to have thin bottoms and their inner
                pot color makes it hard to see the caramel color.
            </li>
            <li>
                On medium low heat, let the sugar dissolve completely.
                <b>Do not touch or stir the mixture.</b> Let the sugar 
                turn to liquid. If necessary, tilt the pot occasionally
                to help dissolve the sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start boiling 3-4 cups of hot water in a kettle and keep
                it hot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the sugar has fully dissolved, increase the heat to
                medium or medium high. Swirl the saucepan once in a while
                to stir the mixture, but <b>do NOT use a utensil</b> or
                the sugar will crystalize. This should take about 5 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the sugar starts to caramelize, you will see lots
                of small bubbles. It will slowly turn brown on the edges
                of the pan. Swirl the pot to incorporate the dark-colored
                caramelized sugar into the light-colored sugar. Soon the
                bubbles will become larger as the sugar mixture caramelizes
                more and turns an amber color. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The caramelized sugar will continue to turn darker and
                darker. Keep swirling the pot and watch it closely. Once
                the caramel sauce starts smoking, wait a tiny bit longer
                until it reaches an optimal dark caramel color. Then, turn
                off the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hold a spatula over the pot. Pour a portion of the 1 tbsp
                of hot water on the spatula and into the caramel pot. 
                The mixture will boil vigorously and sputter, so take care
                not to let it splatter on you. Once this has subsided, 
                slowly add the rest of the hot water. Swirl the saucepan to
                combine. 
            </li>
            <li>
                As soon as the hot caramel sauce is done, pour it directly
                into the molds. It will cool and harden quickly. Aim for a
                thin layer of caramel about 3 mm thick. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making the custard</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan, combine 400 mL of whole milk, 100 mL
                of heavy whipping cream, and 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla 
                extract.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk it all together. Turn the heat on to medium low
                and bring the milk mixture to a simmer. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Crack 3 eggs into a large bowl and beat with a whisk
                until smooth. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 70 grams of sugar to the eggs and mix until everything
                is combined. 
            </li>
            <li>
                When small bubbles start to appear around the edges of
                the saucepan, turn off the heat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                While whisking continulously, slowly add 1/3 of the hot
                milk mixture into the egg mixture. Then, continue to add
                the rest of the milk mixture slowly, again whisking 
                continulously. Mix it all together. Add the hot milk
                mixture <strong>slowly</strong> to keep the eggs from 
                curdling. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Set a fine-mesh sieve over another bowl. Strain 
                the custard mixture through the sieve to remove any
                lumps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Evenly divide the custard mixture among the molds.
                It's important that all of your molds have an equal
                volume of custard so the cooking time will be the
                same. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a lighter, burn off the bubbles on the surface
                of the custard by quickly touching them with the
                flame. You can also pop the bubbles with a toothpick
                or scoop them off with a spoon, but this is time-
                consuming. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Baking the custard</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place the molds in a baking dish that is at least
                2.5 cm deep so we can add hot water to it. Then
                put the dish on a baking sheet. The baking sheet
                makes it easier to transfer the baking dish into 
                the oven after we pour hot water into it. Pour 
                enough hot water so that the molds are half 
                submerged. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the baking dish into the preheated oven and
                bake for 35-45 minutes or until the custard is set.
                If you are using larger or thicker molds, you may
                need to cook it for 45-60 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Check for doneness by tilting the molds. If it is
                done cooking, the surface of the pudding will be
                slightly wobbly but no longer liquid. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Take out the molds from the water bath. Let cool
                completely on a wire rack. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Once cooled, cover the molds with plastic or
                aluminum foil and refridgerate for 2-3 hours. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Serving the pudding</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Run a butter knife or offset spatula along the
                edges of the mold to separate the pudding from
                the mold. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a serving plate face down on top of the
                mold.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip to release the pudding and caramel sauce from
                its mold and onto the plate. If it does not fall
                from the mold, try gently shaking the mold on the 
                plate. 
            </li>
        </ol>
