                    <ol class="steps-list">
                        <li>
                            Preheat the oven to 350ºF and line two 
                            cupcake pans with paper liners.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Combine 2 tsp of vanilla and the 5 oz 
                            of buttermilk in a bowl and set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whisk the 2 eggs and 4 oz of vegetable 
                            oil in a separate bowl and set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the cake flour, granulated sugar, 
                            salt, baking powder, and baking soda to 
                            the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix using the 
                            paddle attachment at a medium-low speed. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the softened butter into the bowl with 
                            the dry ingredients and mix on low until 
                            the mixture resembles wet sand.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour in the mixture of vanilla and 
                            buttermilk from step 2 into the bowl of 
                            the stand mixer. Mix for 1 and a half 
                            minutes at medium speed (speed 4 on Kitchen 
                            Aid, speed 2 on Bosch). The batter will 
                            become fluffy and pale. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the egg mixture in 3 parts and mix on 
                            low until fully combined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fill the liners 2/3 of the way full with 
                            cupcake batter. This should be about 1.5 
                            oz of batter per cupcake. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bake the cupcakes for 15-20 minutes or until 
                            they are just starting to turn golden brown. 
                            The center of the cupcake should bring back 
                            lightly when pressed. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let the cupcakes cool for 5 minutes in their 
                            pan before transferring to a wire rack. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the pint of heavy cream to the bowl of a 
                            stand mixer and beat on high with the whisk 
                            attachment until the cream is frothy. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduce the speed to medium and slowly add the 
                            cup of sifted powered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla 
                            extract into the cream. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whip until the cream has stiff peaks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place the whipped cream in a piping bag and 
                            frost the cooled vanilla cupcakes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place strawberries on top of the cupcake as 
                            desired.
                        </li>

                            The closer your butter is to room temperature, 
                            the sooner the batter will take on the “wet sand” 
                            texture in step 5. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The author of this recipe, Liz Marek, recommends 
                            rotating the cupcakes halfway through their baking 
                            time in step 9 to get an even browning on the top 
                            of the cupcakes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Brushing the fresh strawberries with a light layer 
                            of jam gives the fruit a shiny appearance and 
                            improves their sweetness! I recommend apricot marmalade 
                            or peach jam - anything with a golden brown color. I 
                            think these jams and marmalades add shine to the 
                            strawberries without drastically altering their color. 
                        </li>
