        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Vanilla Cupcake</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces of cake flour</li>
            <li>9 ounces of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp of baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of baking soda</li>
            <li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
            <li>4 ounces of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5 ounces of buttermilk at room temperature</li>
            <li>4 ounces of softened unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Whipped Cream Frosting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pint heavy cream, well chilled</li>
            <li>1 cup sifted icing sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp of vanilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Strawberry garnish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart of fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of apricot marmalade</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Making the cupcakes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350ºF and line two cupcake 
                pans with paper liners.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the vanilla and buttermilk in a separate 
                measuring cup and set it aside. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, add the eggs and oil to a separate bowl 
                then whisk and set them aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cake flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and 
                baking soda to the bowl of your stand mixer with the 
                paddle attachment. You can use a large bowl and an 
                electric mixer if you don’t have a stand mixer, just 
                mix for longer. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Then add the softened butter to the rest of the dry 
                ingredients and mix on low until the mixture resembles
                a sandy texture. Depending on how soft your butter is, 
                this might take a minute or two.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the milk mixture into your dry ingredients and 
                increase the speed to medium (speed 4 on a KitchenAid, 
                speed 2 on a Bosch). Mix for 1 ½ minutes to develop 
                the fluffy structure of the cupcake. The batter will 
                go from being yellow to a fluffy white.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly add your egg mixture in three parts and mix 
                on low until it's fully combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill your liners ⅔ of the way full with the cupcake batter. 
                I use my kitchen scale to measure out 1.5 ounces of batter 
                per cupcake.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the cupcakes for 15-20 minutes or until they are 
                just starting to turn golden brown and the center of 
                the cupcake springs back when you lightly touch it. I 
                rotate my cupcakes halfway through baking for even 
                browning. If you’re making mini cupcakes, bake for 
                less time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let your cupcakes cool in the pans for five minutes, 
                then move them to a cooling rack to cool completely.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Making the whipped cream frosting</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using both a chilled bowl and chilled beaters, 
                beat the cream until frothy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the icing sugar and vanilla gradually while 
                beating.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whip until light and a thick enough consistency 
                to spread as an icing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place into a piping bag and pipe frosting onto 
                the cooled vanilla cupcakes.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Adding the strawberry garnish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Wash and draw strawberries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place strawberries on top of frosted vanilla
                cupcakes. Brush with apricot marmalade. This
                adds a golden shine to the fruit. 
            </li>
        </ol>
